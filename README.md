# Analyze NYSE New York Stock Exchange-Data Google sheet
I collaborate with masterschool on the UDACITY platform to complete this assignment.

In this project, I will calculate summary statistics, derive any conclusions from the statistics, calculate business metrics, and use models to predict the firms' potential future growth. The objective is for you to do an analysis and produce visual tools to present the findings in an understandable manner.


I am working on three separate tasks for this project.
1) I analyzed NYSE data and create a presentation ( in this task I create one scenario base on data and make summary statistics based on measures of central tendency & measures of spread)
2) I made a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement for all companies on available data.
3) I choose one company from the data and Create a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios( Strong, Base, Weak).


## Task > 1 Complete your own data analysis and create a presentation to share your findings,
Data cleaning in a google sheet. the NULL value, extra space, the format of the column, For the data, create named ranges, All column names should be changed to meaningful, space-free names.
The Presentation is then created. I decide which two sectors to present on. I choose the Industrials OR Real Estate

## Task > 2 Develop a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement.
I use a formula to construct the dashboard for this task. You can examine the P/L statement of any corporation. You may alter the company name using the drop-down menu.
 * Total Operating Expenses= SGAs + Operating Expenses
 * Operating Income = Gross Profit - Total Operating Expenses
 * Net Income = Operating Income - (Interest and Taxes)
