# Analyze NYSE New York Stock Exchange-Data Google sheet


In this Project, I work on 3 different tasks.
1) I analyzed NYSE data and create a presentation ( in this task I create one scenario base on data and make summary statistics based on measures of central tendency & measures of spread)
2) I made a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement for all companies on available data.
3) I choose one company from the data and Create a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios( Strong, Base, Weak).
